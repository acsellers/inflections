Inflections for Go
------------------

Inflections for Go is a library for the Go language
that is similar in functionality to the Inflections
part of ActiveSupport that comes with the Rails 
project for the Ruby language. I was implementing a
Go interface for a database that is/was/will continue
to be managed by a Rails codebase. In order to do that
I had to make Go code thing like a Rails codebase.

Long term I want to fill out this library and have
close parity with the Rails code so that other 
programmers who also need this functionality will 
be able to use this library to serve a similar need.
